## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project is structured using **Clean Architecture** principles. The layers are clearly separated to enforce a single responsibility and support scalability and testability:



Presentation (UI Layer - Jetpack Compose)
↓
ViewModel (State Management - Kotlin Flow)
↓
UseCase (Business Logic)
↓
Repository (Interface Abstraction)
↓
Data Layer (Remote APIs - Retrofit, Local DB - Room, Preferences - DataStore)


Each layer is decoupled and testable. Dependency Injection is handled via **Hilt** across all components.
